The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon for the web application. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you can create a favicon using an online favicon generator or design your own icon and save it as `favicon.ico`. 

For now, I will provide a comment indicating that this file is intentionally left blank for you to replace with the actual favicon later.
